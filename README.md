Project1.java
   This class opens the file Countries1.csv using methods outside of the main method,
   and formats the information about them into an array of Country objects. This program
   then interacts with the user, giving them the options to print the Country data, as well
   as to sort the Country data by name, GDP per capita, and happiness.

Country.java
   This class is to make Country objects for Project1.java.
   It includes getter and setter methods, as well as a method
   that calculates the GDP, a method that compares Country
   objects by their names, and a method that prints the information
   about a Country object.
